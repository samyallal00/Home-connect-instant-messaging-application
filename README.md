# Home-connect-instant-messaging-application


This is a little fun application I have made. It mainly allows you to chat with any computer that is connected to your local router and that runs the app also.

It has a little GUI that allows you to manage your incoming calls, from different people.

Is is a based on a Client-Server model, and allows multiple clients to connect to a server. It utilizes the power of Mulithreading in Java, and parallel computing.
